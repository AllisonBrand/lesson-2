Tasks
1. Modify existing static loads
    1. Change constant power load on phase A of `load_1` to 48 kW real power and 24 VAr reactive power.
    2. Add constant impedance load to phase B of `load_2` at 100 Ohm resistance and 10 Ohm reactance.
    3. Remove constant power load on phase C of `load_4` by setting it to 0+0j complex power.
2. Create new static loads
     1. Add `load_115` to `load_114` through `line_114to115`.
     2. Connect `load_116` directly to `load_115`.
